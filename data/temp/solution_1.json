      "Identify the two individuals based on their shirt colors: Man_Blue (wearing blue) and Man_Red (wearing red). Their names are Andrew and Bob.",
      "Analyze the statements: Man_Blue says 'I am Andrew'. Man_Red says 'I am Bob'.",
      "Analyze the condition: We are told that at least one of the men lied.",
      "Evaluate Scenario A: Assume Man_Blue is Andrew. Consequently, Man_Red must be Bob.",
      "Check truthfulness in Scenario A: If Man_Blue is Andrew, his statement 'I am Andrew' is True. If Man_Red is Bob, his statement 'I am Bob' is True.",
      "Test Scenario A against the condition: Since both statements are True, the condition 'at least one lied' is not met. Thus, Scenario A is impossible.",
      "Evaluate Scenario B: Assume Man_Blue is Bob. Consequently, Man_Red must be Andrew.",
      "Check truthfulness in Scenario B: If Man_Blue is Bob, his statement 'I am Andrew' is False (a lie). If Man_Red is Andrew, his statement 'I am Bob' is False (a lie).",
      "Test Scenario B against the condition: Since both men lied, the condition 'at least one lied' is satisfied.",
      "Determine the result: Since Scenario B is the only valid possibility, Man_Red corresponds to Andrew.",
      "Final Answer: Andrew is wearing the red shirt."
