      "Analyze the statement made by B: 'I am the knave.'",
      "If B were a Knight, the statement would be false (since Knights are not Knaves), but Knights always tell the truth. Thus, B cannot be a Knight.",
      "If B were a Knave, the statement would be true (since B would be a Knave), but Knaves always lie. Thus, B cannot be a Knave.",
      "Since B is neither a Knight nor a Knave, B must be the Spy.",
      "Since B is the Spy, A and C must be the Knight and the Knave (in some order).",
      "Analyze the statement made by C: 'I am the spy.'",
      "If C were the Knight, the statement 'I am the spy' would be a lie. Since Knights always tell the truth, C cannot be the Knight.",
      "Therefore, C must be the Knave.",
      "Since C is the Knave, C's statement 'I am the spy' is false, which is consistent with a Knave's behavior.",
      "By elimination, A must be the Knight.",
      "Check A's statement: 'I am the knight.' Since A is the Knight, this is true, which is consistent.",
      "The roles are: A is the Knight, B is the Spy, C is the Knave.",
      "Assuming the implicit question is 'Who is the spy?' (based on the standard puzzle format and the deduction of B as the unique pivot), the answer is B."
