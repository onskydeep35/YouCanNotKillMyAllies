    "strengths": [
      "The solution enumerates the only two possible assignments of names to shirts and checks each, which is a complete case analysis for this problem.",
      "The reasoning correctly eliminates the all-true scenario using the given constraint and identifies the remaining consistent scenario.",
      "The conclusion follows directly and unambiguously from the accepted scenario."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The solution does not explicitly state the implicit logical observation that the two identity-claims are linked: given the two names and two people, the statements must be either both true or both false. Making that explicit would improve clarity.",
      "Minor presentation issue: the argument could be made shorter by noting the linked truth-values of the two statements rather than checking each scenario in full detail."
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "Explicitly state the implicit assumption that each identity-claim is either true or false and that, because there are exactly two people and two names, the claims must be simultaneously true or simultaneously false. This makes the logical step that 'at least one lied' implies both lied immediate.",
      "Mention briefly that there are no other possible scenarios (e.g., ambiguous naming or third parties) to confirm the completeness of the case analysis.",
      "Optionally shorten the solution by observing that since the blue-shirt says 'I am Andrew' and the red-shirt says 'I am Bob', the two statements are complementary: if one is true the other must be true, and if one is false the other must be false. Hence 'at least one lied' forces both to lie, so Andrew must be in red."
