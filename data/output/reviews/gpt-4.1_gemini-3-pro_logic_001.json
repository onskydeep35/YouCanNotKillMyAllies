    "strengths": [
      "The solution clearly enumerates all possible identity assignments and analyzes each scenario.",
      "It correctly applies the constraint that at least one person lied to eliminate impossible scenarios.",
      "The reasoning is logically structured and leads to the correct conclusion."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The solution could be slightly clearer in step 4 by explicitly stating that both statements are lies in Scenario 2, rather than just calling them 'False.'",
      "It does not explicitly state that the condition 'at least one lied' is also satisfied if both lied, which could be clarified for completeness."

    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "In step 4, clarify that both statements are lies, not just 'False.'",
      "Explicitly mention that 'at least one lied' includes the case where both lied, to avoid any ambiguity."
