    "strengths": [
      "Clear, concise case analysis that enumerates the only two possible assignments of names to shirts.",
      "Correctly applies the given condition ('at least one lied') to eliminate the case where both statements are true.",
      "Reasoning leads directly to a single consistent assignment and a clear final answer."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "A very small implicit assumption is not stated explicitly: that each man's statement refers to his own identity in the usual, unambiguous way (i.e., no trick interpretation of 'I' or names).",
      "The solution could be slightly clearer by noting explicitly that the two name assignments considered are exhaustive because there are only two men and two distinct names."
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "State explicitly the assumptions: (a) each statement is about the speaker's own identity and (b) the two possible name-to-shirt assignments considered are exhaustive.",
      "Add a brief justification that the first case is impossible because it violates the given condition 'at least one lied' (i.e., show the logical negation step more explicitly).",
      "Optionally mention that the second case yields both statements false, which still satisfies 'at least one lied', making it the unique valid assignment."
