    "strengths": [
      "The solution clearly labels the two individuals for clarity.",
      "It systematically considers all possible assignments of names to shirt colors.",
      "The reasoning correctly eliminates the case where both statements are true, as it contradicts the problem's condition.",
      "The solution identifies the unique assignment that satisfies the 'at least one lied' condition.",
      "The explanation is logically sound and complete."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The solution could explicitly mention that the case where both statements are false is acceptable under the 'at least one lied' condition, clarifying that 'at least one' does not preclude both."

    "errors": [],
    "suggested_changes": [
      "Add a brief clarification that 'at least one lied' allows for the possibility that both lied, to preempt any confusion."
