  "answer": "Andrew is wearing the red shirt.",
  "reasoning": [
    "Label the blue-shirt person B and the red-shirt person R.",
    "B says \"I am Andrew.\" R says \"I am Bob.\"",
    "If B = Andrew and R = Bob, then B's statement is true and R's statement is true, so neither lied — this contradicts the condition that at least one lied. Therefore that assignment is impossible.",
    "The only remaining assignment is B = Bob and R = Andrew. In that case B's statement \"I am Andrew\" is false and R's statement \"I am Bob\" is false, so at least one (indeed both) lied, satisfying the condition.",
    "Thus the unique consistent solution is that Andrew is the red-shirt person.",
    "No uncertainty: the deduction yields a single consistent assignment."
