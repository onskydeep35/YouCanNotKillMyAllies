    "Let B = man in blue shirt, R = man in red shirt.",
    "Let us assign names: either B is Andrew and R is Bob, or B is Bob and R is Andrew.",
    "B says: 'I am Andrew.' R says: 'I am Bob.'",
    "Case 1: B is Andrew, R is Bob.",
    "Then B's statement ('I am Andrew') is true, R's statement ('I am Bob') is true. Both are telling the truth. But the problem says at least one lied. Contradicts the condition.",
    "Case 2: B is Bob, R is Andrew.",
    "Then B's statement ('I am Andrew') is false (since he is Bob), so B is lying. R's statement ('I am Bob') is also false (since he is Andrew), so R is lying.",
    "In this case, both are lying, which satisfies 'at least one lied.'",
    "Therefore, the only possible assignment is B is Bob (blue shirt is Bob), R is Andrew (red shirt is Andrew).",
    "Thus, Andrew is wearing the red shirt."
