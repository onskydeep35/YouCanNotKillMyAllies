0.95	problem_022	The problem is a challenging combinatorial optimization task involving rankings and performance metrics, typical of advanced mathematics competitions. As a Solver, the agent is well-suited to derive the necessary theoretical bounds, construct the ranking matrix, and calculate the maximum sum. As a Judge, the agent can effectively evaluate the logical consistency of mathematical proofs, verify that proposed constructions meet the eligibility criteria (top b places in a races), and compare different solutions for optimality, although verifying specific 10x10 constructions can be intricate.	9596f230c36d49adb2ea1242f3f13ecf	"<user_input>

Judge: moderately suitable (0.6) because while the problem can admit multiple solution presentations and proofs to compare (correctness, practicality, coin-count limits), the primary demand is constructive derivation rather than comparative critique; evaluation capability is useful but secondary.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_013	"The problem is a well-defined mathematical question in geometric probability/high-dimensional (3D) geometry: three independent continuous uniform variables on [0,1] and a probability involving the region {x^2+y^2+z^2 ≤ 1} intersected with the unit cube. This is low-ambiguity, requires standard analytic methods (geometric reasoning, volume computation, or a triple integral), and has a single clear quantitative answer. 

Solver suitability (0.95): High. A solver is appropriate because the task primarily demands deriving a numerical probability via standard calculus or geometric-volume arguments. It is straightforward to produce a full derivation from first principles and present the result with justification. 

Judge suitability (0.70): Moderate-High. A judge can meaningfully evaluate proposed solutions (check integrals, geometric arguments, numerical approximations, and edge-case reasoning). However, because the problem is short and typically admits a single correct analytic answer, the need for extensive comparative judging of multiple distinct solution strategies is less than the need for synthesis/derivation, so judge suitability is slightly lower than solver suitability."	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_009	The problem is a concise logic/constraint-satisfaction puzzle about truth-values of simple statements by two individuals. Solving requires straightforward propositional reasoning (evaluating truth/falsehood given one person's island membership and the other’s non-membership) with a small, discrete search space and no specialized domain knowledge, so the Solver role is highly appropriate. The Judge role is also reasonable—there can be multiple candidate answers or mistaken inferences to compare and critique—but the problem’s low complexity means deep adjudication is unlikely to be needed, so Judge suitability is somewhat lower.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.98	problem_019	This problem is a complex combinatorial game theory scenario involving strategic reasoning, turn-based moves, and maximizing a guaranteed outcome under adversarial play. It requires constructing a solution from first principles, analyzing possible strategies, and possibly proving optimality, which makes it highly suitable for a solver role. The judge role is also important, as evaluating and comparing different strategic approaches or proofs is nontrivial, but the primary challenge is in deriving the solution itself. Thus, both roles are highly relevant, with a slight edge to the solver due to the problem's constructive and analytical demands.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

Solving it requires constructing a winning strategy or proving a forced loss — i.e., deriving a solution from first principles and producing a correctness argument. Those tasks align directly with the Solver role, so solver suitability is high (1.0). The Judge role (evaluating and comparing multiple solutions) is less central here because the prompt asks for one definitive analysis rather than comparing competing solutions; while a judge could later verify or critique solutions, that is secondary.

The solution can be derived directly with simple combinatorial reasoning (very small search space) and yields a clear optimal schedule, so a Solver is highly suitable. A Judge is less necessary because there are few plausible competing solutions and little need for comparative critique; evaluation would be trivial once a solver provides the schedule.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

1.0	problem_011	The problem is a geometric/spatial reasoning puzzle about movement on the surface of a sphere (the Earth). It requires recognizing special global configurations (e.g., poles or latitudes where a 100 km east/west loop corresponds to an integer number of circumferences), handling case analysis, and producing a clear, rigorous argument or construction of all possible starting points. These demands align well with the Solver role: deriving the solution from first principles, performing spherical-geometry reasoning, and presenting distinct cases (so solver suitability is high). The Judge role is also appropriate because multiple candidate solutions or explanations may be proposed; a judge must compare them, check edge cases, and validate correctness and completeness (including noting special or degenerate cases). Thus the agent is well-suited to evaluate solutions, though the core difficulty centers on constructive derivation, making the Solver role slightly more central.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_022	The problem is a finite combinatorial/optimization question in mathematical reasoning (rankings and performance metrics) asking for a constructive maximum and a proof of optimality for n = 10. This type of problem is well suited to the Solver role: it requires deriving a concrete construction, reasoning about counts and inequalities, and proving maximality — tasks that a solver can perform from first principles. The Judge role is less essential here because the prompt requests a single optimal value rather than asking to compare multiple submitted solutions; a judge could still critique or verify a given solution but is not the primary need. The instance size (n = 10) keeps the combinatorics manageable, further favoring solver suitability.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

Solver suitability: High (0.95) because deriving a minimal-weighing strategy requires combinatorial reasoning, constructing an explicit decision tree of weighings, and exhaustive case analysis—tasks that are well within systematic symbolic/analytic capabilities. Judge suitability: High (0.90) because evaluating, comparing, and critiquing candidate weighing strategies requires checking logical completeness, correctness in all branches, and optimality; this is less creative and mainly verification and comparison, which is also a strong match. Minor deduction from perfect scores reflects the need for careful case bookkeeping (for solver) and exhaustive counterexample checks (for judge).	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

1.0	problem_007	This problem is a classic logic and constraint satisfaction puzzle involving deduction and optimization. It requires the solver to devise a strategy to minimize the number of weighings needed to identify the fake bag. The problem is well-defined and has a unique optimal solution, making it highly suitable for a solver role. The judge role is also appropriate, as there may be multiple proposed strategies or solutions to compare and critique, particularly regarding efficiency and correctness. However, since the problem is standard and typically has a canonical solution, the solver role is slightly more central.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

It requires deriving the expected values for the shortest, medium, and longest pieces after two random cuts, and then manipulating these values to find the product and express it in a specific form. The problem is well-defined, quantitative, and requires multi-step reasoning and integration, making it highly suitable for a solver. The judge role is also relevant, as evaluating multiple solution approaches (e.g., geometric probability, integration, or simulation) and checking correctness is non-trivial, but the main challenge is in the derivation, so solver suitability is slightly higher.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

1.0	problem_019	The problem is a deterministic, finite, perfect-information combinatorial game (Strategic Game Theory, Combinatorial Games) that asks for a constructive guarantee: determine the largest k Ann can force regardless of Bob's play. This requires deriving an explicit strategy, using parity/symmetry/invariant arguments and constructing a proof that no counterplay can prevent at least k occupied chairs. Such tasks are squarely in the Solver role—designing strategies and proving optimality. The Judge role (evaluating or comparing multiple provided solutions) is less central at this stage: it could be useful later to assess candidate strategies or proofs, but the primary task is to produce a new, constructive solution. Therefore I rate Solver suitability high (1.0) and Judge suitability low-to-moderate (0.2).	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_004	The problem is a straightforward rates-and-motion puzzle requiring stepwise arithmetic reasoning (daily net progress with a terminating condition when the frog reaches the rim). This type of task is well suited to a Solver role because it primarily requires constructing a short, deterministic calculation and clear explanation. A Judge could verify or compare multiple solutions, but that role is less critical here because the problem has a single clear answer and limited ambiguity.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_014	The problem is a standard geometric-probability (broken-stick) question: two independent uniform cut points on a unit interval produce three segment lengths, and one must determine the measure of the subset of the sample space where the triangle inequalities hold. Solving requires setting up the 2D uniform distribution of cut positions, handling ordering/case distinctions, and computing areas (integrals) of the region satisfying the inequalities — moderate complexity but purely mathematical and geometric. As an LLM, I am well-suited to derive the solution from first principles, perform the necessary geometric reasoning and integration, and present a clear derivation (high solver suitability). I am also well-suited to act as a judge: I can verify logical steps, check algebra and geometric arguments, identify hidden assumptions (e.g., ordering of cut points), compare alternative solution approaches, and spot calculation errors (high judge suitability). I dock slightly from perfect scores only because careful numeric/integral computation and edge-case assumptions require attention to detail in presentation and checking.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_010	The problem is a logical scheduling puzzle that requires optimizing resources (stove capacity) under constraints. It is highly suitable for a Solver role as it involves deductive reasoning and arithmetic. The problem appears to be a variation of a classic riddle (often involving cooking both sides), but specifically asks for 'one side'. This nuance makes the Judge role particularly valuable to ensure the Solver adheres strictly to the prompt's specific wording rather than defaulting to the solution of the more common version of the riddle.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.95	problem_021	Problem characteristics: a finite, well-defined combinatorial optimization in the domain of rankings/performance metrics for n=1000. As a solver I am well-suited because the task requires discrete combinatorial reasoning, construction of extremal examples, counting/inequality arguments, and careful case analysis — all of which align with strengths in symbolic reasoning, pattern detection, and stepwise derivation. The fixed-size instance (n=1000) suggests looking for general patterns or constructions that scale, which is amenable to systematic derivation. As a judge I am also well-suited (slightly lower score) because evaluating solutions to this problem primarily requires checking logical validity of combinatorial arguments, verifying tightness of bounds, testing edge cases, and comparing alternative constructions — tasks that map to formal verification, counterexample generation, and critique of proof steps. Potential pitfalls to watch for (as a judge) include hidden assumptions about symmetry or independence between races, off-by-one errors in counting top-b placements, and ensuring constructed examples indeed achieve claimed maxima. Based solely on the provided problem statement and category, both roles are appropriate, with a modest preference for solver capability given the constructive nature of the question.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

Solver suitability (0.95): The problem can be solved from first principles by logical deduction or simple case enumeration; it has clear constraints and a likely unique consistent assignment, so deriving a solution from scratch is straightforward and well within typical symbolic-reasoning capabilities. Judge suitability (0.8): Evaluating and critiquing candidate solutions is also feasible—one need only check that role assignments and truth-values of the three statements satisfy the definitions. Because the puzzle is simple, judging is less challenging than solving (fewer subtle pitfalls or large solution spaces), so slightly lower but still high suitability.

1.0	problem_018	The problem is a standard probability/puzzle (airplane seating) requiring elementary probabilistic reasoning, symmetry arguments, or simple recursion to derive a single numeric answer. As a solver, the task is well within capability: it requires clear step-by-step analytic reasoning, handling conditional cases, and producing a decimal probability. As a judge, the task is likewise suitable: candidate solutions are typically short and rely on identifiable arguments (symmetry, induction, or case analysis), so it is straightforward to evaluate correctness, spot logical gaps or incorrect conditioning, and compare alternative derivations. Common pitfalls (overcomplicating, miscounting cases) are easy to detect, making both solving and judging highly feasible.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.9	problem_011	The problem is a geometric logic puzzle involving spherical geometry and navigation. It is a variation of a classic riddle. The specific sequence of movements (North, East, West, South) simplifies the geometric complexity compared to other variations (like South, East, North) because the East and West movements occur at the same latitude, effectively cancelling each other out. An LLM is highly suitable as a Solver to deduce this logic and identify potential edge cases (e.g., crossing the North Pole). It is also highly suitable as a Judge because the solution is objectively verifiable based on geometric principles.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

A solver is essential to model the game's mechanics, identify the underlying mathematical structure (likely related to invariants or graph theory on a cycle), and calculate the maximum guaranteed value. A judge is also highly suitable because the solution involves a proof of optimality, which requires rigorous evaluation to ensure that Bob's counter-strategies are fully accounted for and that the mathematical logic is sound.	44b6ef7363d0491e903fe248294a74b7	"<user_input>

Solver suitability: high (0.95) because deriving the correct assignment requires straightforward logical deduction or simple exhaustive checking; no specialized domain knowledge is needed and the solution can be produced from first principles. Judge suitability: high (0.9) because evaluating candidate solutions involves checking each proposed assignment for consistency with the four statements (i.e., verifying truth/falsity against the supposed species), comparing alternative answers, and pointing out logical errors; the task is unambiguous and readily verifiable.

1.0	problem_012	The problem is a well-defined mathematical / geometric probability question about two uniformly random cut points on a unit segment and the expected lengths of the order statistics (shortest, middle, longest). Solving it requires standard techniques in probability and calculus (order statistics, integration over the triangle of cut points, or symmetry arguments), which are routine for a solver with analytic capability. Verifying solutions requires checking integrals, handling piecewise regions correctly, and confirming the final rational product p/q; these are straightforward to evaluate and compare. Therefore the agent is well-suited both to derive a solution from scratch and to judge and critique alternative solutions.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

1.0	problem_020	This problem is a classic logic puzzle involving truth-tellers and liars, requiring careful analysis of statements and their logical implications. As a solver, the task is to deduce the number of frogs by systematically analyzing the constraints given by each amphibian's statement. This is well-suited for a solver role, as it involves step-by-step reasoning and deduction. For the judge role, the problem allows for the evaluation of different solution approaches (e.g., truth tables, direct deduction), but the scope for critique is somewhat limited since the problem is precise and typically admits a unique solution. Thus, the solver role is slightly more suitable, but the judge role is also highly appropriate.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

0.98	problem_021	This problem is a complex mathematical/logical reasoning task involving combinatorics and optimization over rankings and performance metrics. It requires deriving a solution from scratch, including understanding the definitions, constructing possible scenarios, and maximizing a sum over all students. This makes it highly suitable for a solver role. The judge role is also relevant, as evaluating and comparing multiple solution approaches (e.g., different constructions or optimization strategies) would require careful logical analysis, but the primary challenge is in constructing the solution itself. Therefore, the solver score is slightly higher than the judge score.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>

1.0	problem_014	This is a classic problem in geometric probability with a well-defined mathematical solution. A Solver can derive the answer by applying the triangle inequality to the lengths of the three segments and calculating the relative area in a 2D coordinate space. A Judge can effectively critique the derivation steps and verify the application of the triangle inequality constraints.	648073e146864e848958ab316d0c216a	"<user_input>
