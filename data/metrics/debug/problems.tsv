Truthfulness	"In a magical swamp, there are two species of talking amphibians: toads whose statements are always true, and frogs whose statements are always false.

Four amphibians, Brian, Chris, LeRoy, and Mike live together in this swamp, and they make the following statements:

Brian: ""Mike and I are different species.""
Chris: ""LeRoy is a frog.""
LeRoy: ""Chris is a frog.""
Mike: ""Of the four of us, at least two are toads.""

What is the probability that the last passenger sits in their assigned seat? Give the answer as a decimal.	medium	problem_018	0.5	Mathematical/Logical Reasoning	problem_018
Combinatorial Games	At a party with 99 guests, the hosts Ann and Bob play a game (the hosts themselves are not counted as guests). There are 99 chairs arranged in a circle, and initially all guests are standing. The hosts take turns alternately, with Ann moving first. On a turn, a host orders any standing guest to sit on an unoccupied chair c. If at least one chair adjacent to c is already occupied, the same host must order one guest sitting on such an adjacent chair to stand up (if both adjacent chairs are occupied, the host chooses exactly one of them). All orders are carried out immediately. Ann’s goal is to ensure that after some move of hers, at least k chairs are occupied. Determine the largest value of k that Ann can guarantee, regardless of how Bob plays.	hard	problem_019	34	Strategic Game Theory	problem_019
