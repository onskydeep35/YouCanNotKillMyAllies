The subsequent 100 km east and 100 km west legs are taken along the same small circle (parallel) at latitude φ1, so they cancel exactly and return the helicopter to the same longitude λ0. Finally flying 100 km south decreases latitude by δ back to φ1 - δ = φ0 while leaving longitude unchanged. Thus the final point coincides with the start S.', ""Case B — Exact arrival at the North Pole (φ1 = 90°): The helicopter reaches the pole coming along the meridian λ0. At the pole, 'east' and 'west' are not well-defined (every longitude meets at the pole). If the east/west instructions are interpreted as leaving the helicopter at the pole (no change in position) and the final south leg is taken along the same meridian used to approach the pole, the helicopter returns to the starting point. However, because the directions 'east'/'west' are ambiguous at the pole, the instruction sequence is not well-defined in this case and the outcome depends on how 'east'/'west' are interpreted. This makes the exact-pole case ambiguous rather than deterministically returning to S under the given instructions."", ""Case C — Pole crossing (φ1 > 90°): The helicopter passes the pole. On a sphere, when a northward meridional displacement overshoots the pole by an angular amount α = φ1 - 90°, the position after crossing is at latitude φ1' = 90° - α, and the longitude is shifted by 180° (λ = λ0 + 180°), i.e., the helicopter is on the opposite meridian at the same angular distance from the pole as the overshoot amount. The east and west legs at that latitude cancel, leaving the helicopter at latitude φ1' and longitude λ0 + 180°. The final south leg reduces latitude by δ to φ_final = φ1' - δ. In general φ_final ≠ φ0, and the final longitude is λ0 + 180°, not λ0; therefore the helicopter does not return to S. Concrete illustration: start 50 km south of the North Pole (φ0 = 90° - 50/R). After 100 km north you are 50 km beyond the pole on the opposite meridian; after east and west cancel you are still 50 km south of the pole on the opposite meridian; flying 100 km south from there puts you 150 km south of the pole on the opposite meridian — not the starting point."", ""Conclusion: For starting points whose northward 100 km leg does not reach or cross the North Pole (i.e., starting at least 100 km from the North Pole), the helicopter returns to its starting point. If the north leg crosses the North Pole (starting strictly within 100 km of the Pole), the helicopter does not return to the starting point. If the north leg ends exactly at the Pole the instructions are ambiguous because 'east'/'west' lose meaning; under one reasonable interpretation (treat east/west as null while returning along the same meridian) the helicopter would return, but the instruction sequence as given is not well-defined at the pole.""]"	gpt-5-mini	problem_011	"[{'accepted': True, 'critique': 'Consider explicitly mentioning that the North and South legs are along the same meridian because the East and West legs are of equal length and occur at the same latitude, thus resulting in zero net change in longitude before the final South leg begins.', 'response': ""Accepted.

If at least one chair adjacent to c is already occupied, the same host must order one guest sitting on such an adjacent chair to stand up (if both adjacent chairs are occupied, the host chooses exactly one of them).

If at least one neighbor is occupied, the host must remove one guest from an adjacent chair, so |S| remains the same. Thus, |S| is non-decreasing."",
      ""Ann wants to maximize the maximum value of |S| reached after one of her moves, while Bob wants to minimize it. Bob will always pick a chair adjacent to an occupied one to keep |S| constant. Ann will always pick a chair not adjacent to any occupied chair to increase |S| by 1, as long as such a chair exists."",
      ""Let V = S ∪ N(S) be the set of chairs that are either occupied or adjacent to an occupied chair. |S| increases if and only if Ann picks a chair c ∉ V. When Ann picks such a chair, the size of V increases. To keep V small, Ann will pick c such that its neighbors are already in V as much as possible. However, since c ∉ V, at least c and one of its neighbors must be new to V, so |V| increases by at least 2 on Ann's turn."",
      ""On Bob's turn, he can move a guest to an adjacent unoccupied chair. This 'shifting' can increase the size of V by 1 if the new neighbor was not previously in V. Bob will use this to maximize |V| and thus limit Ann's ability to increase |S|."",
      ""In each round (one move by Ann and one by Bob), |S| increases by 1 on Ann's turn, and |V| increases by at least 2 (Ann's move) + 1 (Bob's move) = 3. Initially, |V| = 0. After round 1, |S| = 1 and |V| = 3. After round 2, |S| = 2 and |V| = 6. In general, after Bob's m-th turn, |V| can be as large as 3m."",
      ""Ann can guarantee reaching |S| = k if after Bob's (k-1)-th turn, |V| < 99. If |V| reaches 99, no chair c ∉ V exists, and Ann cannot increase |S| further. Since Bob can force |V| to increase by 3 each round, |V| will reach 3 * 33 = 99 after Bob's 33rd turn."",
      ""Therefore, Ann can reach |S| = 33 on her 33rd move (since |V| was 3 * 32 = 96 after Bob's 32nd turn). However, after Bob's 33rd turn, |V| will be 99, and Ann's 34th move will not be able to increase |S| to 34. Thus, the largest value of k Ann can guarantee is 33.""
